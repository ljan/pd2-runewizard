## What is it?

Click on the runes to mark which ones you have found. The available runewords will be highlighted automatically.

The table can be sorted : try clicking on the table headings, you may find it useful!

## Runes

The runes are listed in order of rarity, from top to bottom, and left to right. The runes upgrade formula in Project Diablo 2 has been changed to the following:

**El - Pul: 3 runes + Key**

**Um - Zod: 2 runes + Key**

## Runewords

**Season 6 New and Updated Runewords** have a small <span class="rw-Table-tdTitlePatch">S6 New/Upd</span> icon next to the name.
